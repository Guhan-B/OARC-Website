              The legendary poet Bharathi wants us to explore the globe, bring
              all latest knowledge to strengthen the country. We all know the
              famous expression by Isaac Newton “If I have seen further it is by
              standing on the shoulders of Giants”.
            </p>
            <p>
              WeCollect is an effort to literally stand on the shoulders of
              giants and bring back the knowledge from across the globe!!!
              Thanks to the internet and technology, there is so much wealth of
              presentable knowledge that is freely available, curated, and ready
              to be consumed on almost all topics in the world. We do not even
              have to travel to different countries!! However, these rich
              resources are not exploited by the needy for several reasons -
              lack of a catalog and the difficulty of finding what is needed are
              the most-often cited barriers. Our initiative aims to create a
              repository of all such Open Educational Resources (OERs) related
              to Research Methods relevant for researchers from multiple
              disciplines and multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and
              transdisciplinary researchers to alleviate the barrier.

              This is a competition open to all the members of Thiruvalluvar
              University, especially to researchers - inclusive of research
              supervisors, teaching staff members passionate about Research
              Methods or a doctoral student or an MPhil student. You can submit
              any number of resources. Each submission will be assessed by
              experts based on the rubrics. If you submit more than one
              resource, your score will be the sum of all the scores of your
              submissions. Resources in English or Tamil are only eligible for
              this competition. Other languages are out of scope at this point
              in time.

            <h2>Some Information on OER</h2>
            <p>
              OER stands for "Open Educational Resources" and is associated with
              an educational movement that began about 20 years ago and has
              become a global educational movement. The open provision of
              educational resources, enabled by Information and Communication
              Technologies (ICT), for consultation, use and adaptation by the
              community of users for non-commercial purposes. OER are digitised
              materials offered freely and openly for educators, students and
              self learners to use and reuse for teaching, learning and
              research.
            </p>
            <p>
              The resource should be either in the public domain or released
              with an open license. An OPEN license is a type of license that
              grants permission to access, re-use and redistribute a work with
              few or no restrictions. These resources include complete online
              courses, course materials, modules, textbooks, streaming videos,
              tests, assessment tools, software, many other tools, materials &
              techniques that are useful for teaching, learning, as well as for
              research purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The terms “open content” and “open educational resources” describe
              any copyrightable work that is either (1) in the public domain or
              (2) licensed in a manner that provides users with free and
              perpetual permission to engage in the 5R activities:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Retain – the right to make, own, and control copies of the
                content (e.g., download, duplicate, store, and manage)
              </li>
              <li>
                Reuse – the right to use the content in a wide range of ways
                (e.g., in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a video)
              </li>
              <li>
                Revise – the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the
                content itself (e.g., translate the content into another
                language)
              </li>
              <li>
                Remix – the right to combine the original or revised content
                with other material to create something new (e.g., incorporate
                the content into a mash up)
              </li>
              <li>
                Redistribute – the right to share copies of the original
                content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (e.g., give
                a copy of the content to a friend)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Example: <strong>MOOCS</strong>: MOOCs stands for Massive Open
              Online Courses. These are free online courses and any individual
              can enroll. MOOCs offer a wide range of courses in many different
              subjects for individuals to be able to evolve their knowledge and
              education in an affordable and easy manner.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many materials casually recognized as OER, technically, do not
              fall into that category. For example, a video that has a creative
              commons license might not necessarily be open; the agreement may
              instead allow it to be freely used but not altered or repurposed.
              . Other materials allow sharing and modifications but only within
              a paid subscription service. Materials thus restricted in one or
              more of the 5R aspects would not be considered OER.
            </p>
            <p>
              That does not mean OER has to be completely nonprofit. To make
              ongoing OER projects sustainable, some have allowed companies to
              offer organized “playlists” or other curated packages of materials
              for a fee. projects, such as the SciShow series on YouTube, allow
              donations through patronage websites such as Patreon and Subable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inspired by an open source license move in the world of computing
              in 2001, a group of experts comprised of educators, technologists,
              legal scholars, investors, entrepreneurs, and philanthropists
              formed a not-for-profit organization called Creative Commons and
              developed the first set of open licenses in 2002. This brought a
              much needed clarity about sharing materials online.

              For the competition, please do NOT submit the entire OER
              repository. Instead, submit specific content from any such OER
              repository relevant for the identified learning outcomes. For
              example, you can submit

                "Qualitative case study methodology: Study design and
                implementation for novice researchers."

              "The Qualitative Report, 13 (4)" by Baxter, P. & Jack, S. with the

            <p>
              When you submit the OER, please specify the type of content
              (reading material, quiz, assignment question etc. ) along with the
              author details. If you are the author, please provide your full
              name, organization and contact details. For the example given
              above, the type of content would be "reading material" and the
